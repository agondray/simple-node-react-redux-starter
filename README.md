CSS hot-reloading currently doesn't work. However, hot-reloading for inline styling works fine.

1. `npm install` to install dependencies
2. `npm run build` to build the webpack bundle
3. `npm run serve` to run the development server
3.5 Alternatively, you could run `npm run serve` to delete the build folder, build the webpack bundle, and start the server.
